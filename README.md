### Mind-Reader

This is another early project that uses a simple mathematics trick to "predict" the number the user is thinking of. It guides the user through step-by-step instructions that associate their number with a symbol. The final result displays a symbol associated with the user's chosen number. The project focuses on state management to progress forward to the next view, backward to the previous view, and reset to the first view on the page.
