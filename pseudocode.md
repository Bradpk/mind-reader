Thinking outloud

    Each page will be an object in an array of objects

    Each one of those objects will have different properties that will be the different elements on the page.

    Every time the button is clicked it will "change state" by moving to the next object in the array resulting in the elements on the page changing.
    
    The objects in the array will need:
    object 1: h1, go button(goes to the next object in the array)
    object 2: h1, next button(goes to the next object in the array), p, reverse button(goes to the first object in the array) 
    object 3: h1, next button(goes to the next object in the array), p, p, reverse button(goes to the first object in the array) 
    object 4: h1, next button(goes to the next object in the array), p, p, reverse button(goes to the first object in the array) 
    object 5: h1, next button(goes to the next object in the array), p, p, reverse button(goes to the first object in the array) 
    object 6: symbol, p, smaller symbol, reverse button(goes to the first object in the array)
